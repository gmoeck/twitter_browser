#Twitter Browser Example
This is a simple application that was built for the Introduction to
Sproutcore traning series put on by Strobe. You can view the video for
building this application
[here](http://www.strobecorp.com/products-press/).

#Running the applicaiton
The application depends on a backend rails client that simplifies and
aggregates the json coming from the twitter api. You can find the
backend [here](http://www.github.com/gmoeck/twitter_browser_backend).
First start the rails server, then run sc-server and goto
http://localhost:4020/twitter_browser.
